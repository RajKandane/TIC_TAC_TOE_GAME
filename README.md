## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their respective symbols (usually X and O) in an attempt to form a row, column, or diagonal of three symbols. The first player to achieve this wins the game. If all cells are filled, and no player has formed a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used

The Tic Tac Toe game was developed using the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## Features

- Interactive 3x3 grid to play the game.
- Players can take turns by clicking on the cells to place their symbols.
- Real-time status display, indicating whose turn it is and the game result (win, draw, or ongoing).
- Option to reset the game and start a new match.

## Getting Started

To play the Tic Tac Toe game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The game will load, and you can start playing immediately.

## Directory Structure
- /css               # Directory for CSS styles for the game interface
    - styles.css      # CSS file with styling rules
- /js                # Directory for JavaScript code and game logic
    - script.js       # JavaScript file containing the Tic Tac Toe game logic
- index.html         # HTML file with the game's UI structure
- README.md          # Project's README file


## Additional Information

### Implementation Details

The game logic is implemented in the `script.js` file using vanilla JavaScript. It handles player moves, checks for winning conditions, and updates the game status in real-time. The `styles.css` file provides custom styling to create an appealing and user-friendly interface for the game.

### Future Enhancements

The current version of the Tic Tac Toe game is a basic implementation. For future enhancements, some possible features to consider are:

- Adding an AI opponent with different difficulty levels.
- Implementing a scoreboard to keep track of player wins and draws.
- Adding animations and transitions for a smoother user experience.
